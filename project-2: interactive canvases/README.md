This folder was made on March 19th 2025 after talking with my uncle Dave Ryan:
- Site full of beautiful art made with processing library: http://artblocks.io/
- P5 "textbook": https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/mtec1101-hd88-sp2022/files/2019/03/Make_Getting-Started-with-p5dotjs.pdf


Ideas:
- make document full of p5 commands, functions, etc. for later use
- Piece idea: color of background changes according to the mouse x/y input

RGB & HSB are two different ways of communicating color
